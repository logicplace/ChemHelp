Quick but surprisingly not too dirty program intending to aid me in doing my
 Chemistry homework. Because programming is far more fun than actually doing
 my homework.

Note that I'm only in Chem 1 so far so this is pretty basic, and will likely
 remain so for a while. But I'll probably stick a few things in there as I
 progress.

Only a command line interface at the moment and that's all I really care to do.

Basic idea for the interface is, there will be a menu then a prompt, and you
 make your selection by typing what's before the ending parenthesis. When
 prompted without a menu, basic help or comments will be in parentheses and the
 default action (when you press enter without typing anything) will be in
 brackets. If no default action is listed, assume it's "cancel".

When it asks for an element, enter the symbol (eg. H for Hydrogen). If you don't
 know the symbol, use the lookup function from the main menu. Name lookups are
 case insensitive, but spelling counts!
